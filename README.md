Professional review sites acknowledge Smart DNS Proxy's exceptional streaming capabilities, confirming it successfully unblocks Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, BBC iPlayer, Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max.

The service is recommended primarily for users prioritizing streaming access over anonymity and security.
